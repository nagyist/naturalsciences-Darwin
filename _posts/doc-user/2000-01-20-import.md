----------

First (and quick) steps
---------


Since October 2013, **Darwin** allow you to import your data via a pre-formated XML template.
You can use this functionality by clicking on Import on the Administration menu.

![Clic on the import link]({{ ASSET_PATH }}/../../images/import/goto-import.png)

You are now on a kind of search import page.

![Import search]({{ ASSET_PATH }}/../../images/import/import_search.png)

This page display all already downloaded files.
You see all file on collections where you have rights (so you can even this files downloaded by other encoders)
> **Note:** *be aware that a downloaded file is not automaticaly imported to Darwin, it require some human contribution*

As you can, several information are listed :

1. (Collection) : Is the collection affiliated to the import file, you must define it before the import process
2. (Filename) : Just the name of your xml file
3. (status) : describe the actual status of your file, you can have more information about available status by clicking on the **info button (i)**. 

> **Note** : Some status need an automatic update made by the system (such as *processing* or *loading*), you just have to wait until the status of your import change. 

4. (last modification) : give you the date of the last modification specificly for this import process
5. (progression) : show you 2 numbers, the first is the number of already imported record in Darwin, the second is the total of record in your file. (in the example above, 6 record are already imported, so 994 records await for import)
6. (Import a file) : it's this button that will allow you to download yout xml file
7. (actions buttons) : there are some available button here, if you put your cursor on a button, the name of the button appear. If you want more info about available buttons, click on the **info button (i)** 

### Download a xml file

To import your own file, click on the **import a file** button (6 on the image above)
You'il just have to select your file, the associated collection and the format of your xml file. Actualy only 'ABCD' format is available (*an abcdefg file can be imported with ou abcd format*)

Simply click on the submit button to add your file. you will automaticaly been redirected to the import search page. You wil see your file with a *To be loaded* or *loading* status, once the system finish the download of the file, the status will change into *pending*.

### Import your data

Your file is well downloaded but nothing is imported in Darwin yet. Darwin will look your record one by one to look for potential problem (eg: a people or catalogue not encoded in Darwin).
When your file is in a *pending* state, Darwin finished to check for problem. Then you can **edit** ([left button in point 7 of this image](#image2)) to see witch problem the system found (or to check no problem was found).

When you click on edit you arrive on a page where all record in your file were listed.
When something appear in red or orange, you'll have to check the detected problem. some field will appear in green : good news ! Darwin found a related record in its database.

Once a record don't have problem anymore, you can **"import ok line"** to really import records in Darwin.

> **Note** : when you clioc on **Import ok line** button, your file take the **Processing** Status, You won't be hable to edit your file until the process is over

When your "ok" lines is well imported, if it remains lines to import, your file status will change to **Pending**. If you have imported all "ok" lines, your file status will change to **Finished** 
A finished file isn't editable anymore, it is still displayed to information purpose.

> **Note** : By defautl finished fils are not displayed, click on **Show finished** checkbox to also see finished files

F.A.Q. 
----------

1. My File is loaded but I can't do anything

![Loaded status]({{ ASSET_PATH }}/../../images/import/import_loaded.jpg)

The **Loaded** Status inform you that your file is weel loaded, but the application still need to check your data. So you just have to wait until your status become **pending**.


2. Darwin tells me it can't find the taxon/chrono/litho/mineral but this one really exists in Darwin !

![Existing catalogue in error]({{ ASSET_PATH }}/../../images/import/bad_taxon.jpg)

It is possible that an existing taxon/chrono/litho/mineral is still displayed in error. It's probably because the specified **level_name**  or **parent** doesn't match, even if you've specified exactly the same name,
if the **level** or the **parent** doesn't match, Darwin concider that it's not the same thing.


3. When I edit my file there are no errors displayed

![Existing catalogue in error]({{ ASSET_PATH }}/../../images/import/import_no-error.jpg)

Well done ! Your file fits perfectly, Click to **Back to import** and then click on the **Import "Ok" lines** button ([second button in point 7 of this image](#image2))
