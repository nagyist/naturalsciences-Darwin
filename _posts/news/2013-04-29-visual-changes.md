Hi, 
as some of you may noticed, some new things appeared in today's stable branch;
Some visual changes and some more features.

The biggest and more notable change is the widget layout that has been changed to take 
less screen space and and the widget drawer reorganisation that lead to easier manipulation
of widgets.

You may also notice the new option to search item containing associated files (like images , pdf , ...).

You also now have the ability to "bulk update" General Inventory numbers using the "mass update" for specimens.

Many other small fix and features where also added ...and will be added soon ;)

Stay tuned !
