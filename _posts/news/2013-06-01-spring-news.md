Hey everyone, 
as the sun is slowly moving to our land, we descided to release the next batch of 
changes in darwin.

Most important changes are under the hood : saved searched, text search, installer, ...

We've also drop the support for postgresql 8.4 as it's 4 years old
But some of them are visible for the user :

* A new map library is used : Leaflet . That give us the possiblity to display more pins on the map, 
to be faster and last but not least to display points that share the exact location.

* A new 'Name' field for parts, enabling you to give a pretty name for your specimens ... like 'Laika the dog'
